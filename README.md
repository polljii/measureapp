### Rubric Scorecards Automation for Cebu Schools &amp; LGUs
> Developed a comprehensive solution for automating rubric-based
            evaluations used by schools and local government units (LGUs) across
            Cebu. Built the backend API, custom ranking algorithm, and mobile
            application to digitize and streamline the scoring process. The
            system enabled standardized assessments, real-time result
            aggregation, and transparent rankingâ€”improving efficiency and
            consistency in program evaluation and performance tracking.
